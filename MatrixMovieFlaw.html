      Machines using humans as power source is fundamentally flawed -
        <ol>
          <li>There is no perpetual motion machine (of 1st or 2nd kind), feeding dead humans intravenously to living humans will eventually run out.</li>
          <li>Machines could have used other lower forms of animals as power source. They would accept any simulation easily, unlike complicated human brain.</li>
        </ol>
      So what's the alternative story? Well, machines enslaved humans and used them as supercomputers. To run their models etc. (like humans use supercomputers today).
