      While God exists objectively, Karma is non-existent/subjective. We make choices all the time and end in some state. If good choice results in good state then we say good karma. If bad choice results in bad state then we say bad karma. This is purely random (see "Does God Exist?"). We remember these coincidences and that correlation feels like karma. Correlation is not causation.
