      <p>
      Many great philosophers talk about rebirth, so it must be true? Rebirth is often defined as an eternal existence of the soul, where it moves from one physical body to another in a cycle. While I believe in rebirth/reincarnation, the definition is different. Rebirth is nothing but giving birth. To come out of cycle of rebirth is same as not giving birth.
