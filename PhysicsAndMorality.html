      People often argue that physics (as opposed to religion) cannot explain right/wrong (morality) and hence physics is fundamentally incomplete or incorrect. This statement cannot be more absurd. Yes, physics does not talk about morality - because there is no right or wrong, because such a concept does not exist at all. What is right today, can be wrong tomorrow. What is wrong here, can be right there.
